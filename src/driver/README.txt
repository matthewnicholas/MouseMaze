Help Micky find his way out.
Add code to move the mouse throughout the maze.
He cannot walk on X's (only on open spaces)
The end of the maze is marked with and E.
The mouse can only be moved with the
moveUp, moveDown, moveLeft, moveRight methods,
but you may add additional methods to call those
methods according to the mouse's soundings.
Note that my test maze will be different but will follow the same format.

For 10 additional points:
add the ability to have more than one mouse in the maze.
Mice cannot step on each other and
the simulation doesn't end until each mouse has found the end of the maze.
It could be interesting to test out different Mouse solutions on each Mouse

You may work individually or in groups of 2 but
both submissions must be the first line (in comments) of the file
(you may also add it as submission notes).
Only 1 submission is needed for groups of 2 but remember to include your names.
