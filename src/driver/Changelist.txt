	+Package                                            
		is now "driver" since that is where main is
	+Mouse                                              
		-condensed spacing for
		 one-line getters/setters 
		-shadowed X and Y in Mouse(int, int)
	+Project
		-split classes into their own files so they
		 are easier for two people to edit.
